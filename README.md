### Rise of Picture Stamper
I developed this tiny app to organise a kermis of my wife's school. 
At first time, i recognize that they were using photoshop to create tickets "save as" all tickets. But, you know, it takes a long time. I stopped them then i gave this app to them. Of course, my wife like it too much. Because in 3 seconds, she had one thousand kermis ticket with numbers. Then she send the tickets to printing house. Done!
